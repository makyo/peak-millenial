Peak Millennial v1.0
====================

A one-page RPG about boomers, doomers, zoomers, and bloomers.

Requirements
------------

* A deck of playing cards (including jokers)
* Four people
* Pen and paper for each person to tally.

Setup
-----

1. Shuffle the deck of cards.
2. Pass the deck around.
    1. Each person draws until they get a unique suit and reveals their class. ♦ = boomer; ♠ = doomer; ♥ = zoomer; ♣ = bloomer.
    2. Then they draw and reveal three cards and announce/note their stats for FINances, TECHnology, and SOCial credit (ace = 1, faces = 10, joker = draw again).
    3. Then they draw one more card without showing anyone for their SANity level.
    4. Then they shuffle the deck.

### Additional (de)buffs

* Boomers start with +1 FIN and +1 SAN.
* Doomers start with -2 SAN.
* Zoomers start with +1 TECH and +1 SAN.
* Bloomers start with +1 SOC and +1 SAN.

After applying, ensure the minimum for each stat is 1 and the maximum is 9

Play
----

* The boomer begins, because of course, then play goes clockwise.
* For each turn, the player draws a card and performs the specified action.
    * Most actions are performed against other players; some are performed against specific players.
    * If the current player gain a point in a stat, the other player loses a point in that stat and vice versa.
    * Every time the current player performs an action against another player, they lose 1 SAN regardless.
    * Jokers are an immediate loss of 1 SAN to the current player.
* SAN levels are kept secret, so either note those separately, or agree to read off the other three stats at the end of each round.

Win/lose conditions
--------------

* You win if you max out two stats to 10 or your sanity reaches zero. Maybe then you'll actually be happy!
* The other players can keep playing to see who gets out last.
* If you would win on the first turn, you are instead knocked out of the game. Sorry, you were too lucky!
* You get knocked out of the game if any stat except SAN reaches zero. Hard to be happy that way.
* If you somehow manage to make it through the deck, the game ends in a draw.
