    2. Then they draw and reveal three cards and announce/note their stats for FINances, TECHnology, and SOCial credit (ace = 1, faces = 10, joker = draw again).
    3. Then they draw one more card without showing anyone for their SANity level.
    4. Then they shuffle the deck.

### Additional (de)buffs

* Zoomers start with +1 TECH and +1 SAN.
* Bloomers start with +1 SOC and +1 SAN.

After applying, ensure the minimum for each stat is 1 and the maximum is 9

Play
----

The boomer begins, because of course, then play goes clockwise. For each turn, the player draws a card and performs the specified action. Most actions are performed against other players, and some are performed against specific players. Every time you perform an action against another player, they lose 1 SAN. Jokers mean an immediate loss of 1 SAN to the current player. SAN levels are kept secret, so you can either note those separately, or agree to read off the other three stats at the end of each round. If you would win on the first turn, you are instead knocked out of the game.
