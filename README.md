Peak Millenial
==============

A one-page RPG about boomers, doomers, zoomers, and bloomers.

Requirements
------------

* A deck of playing cards (including jokers)
* Four people
* Pen and paper for each person to tally.

Setup
-----

1. Shuffle the deck of cards.
2. Pass the deck around.
    1. Each person draws and reveals a card, which determines their class (draw until you get a unique suit). ♦ = boomer; ♠ = doomer; ♥ = zoomer; ♣ = bloomer.
    2. Then they draw and reveal three cards and announce/note their stats for Finances, Technology, and Social Credit (ace = 1, faces = 10, joker = reshuffle deck and draw again).
    3. They draw one more card without showing anyone for their Sanity level.
    4. Shuffle the deck.

Boomers start with +1 Finances.
Doomers start with -1 Sanity.
Zoomers start with +1 Technology
Bloomers start with +1 Social Credit

Play
----

The boomer begins, because of course, then play goes clockwise. For each turn, the player draws a card and performs the specified action. Most actions are performed against other players, some are formed against specific players. Every time you perform an action against another player, they lose a sanity point. Jokers mean an immediate loss of one sanity point. Sanity levels are kept secret, so you can either note those separately, or agree to read off the other three stats at the end of each round.
